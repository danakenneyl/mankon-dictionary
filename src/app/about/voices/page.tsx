                  Judith Shu Tse, originally from Mankon in Bamenda, Cameroon, spent the first 25 years of her life immersed in the rich traditions, values, and beliefs of the Mankon culture. 
                  Her upbringing deeply shaped her identity, and she actively participated in community events and social activities as a young woman to further connect with and define her cultural roots.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Even after traveling abroad and being exposed to diverse cultures during her education, Judith found a renewed appreciation for her heritage. She realized that she felt most at ease and 
                  grounded when surrounded by individuals who shared her cultural values and beliefs. This deep connection to her roots played a significant role in her personal and professional success in multicultural environments.
                </p>

                <p>
                Now a Doctor of Nursing Practice, Judith uses her expertise not only to promote health and wellness but also to champion cultural awareness, particularly among children and young adults in her 
                community. Her passion for preserving the Mankon culture remains strong, and she was thrilled to support a research project dedicated to promoting the Mankon language and traditions. For Judith, 
                her culture is her identity, and she is committed to ensuring that future generations, including her own children, have the opportunity to know and benefit from it.

                <p>Dana Kenney-Lillejord is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Linguistics at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. Her research interests are grounded in low-resource language work, and she recently completed her honors thesis exploring the phonology of Mankon. Dana strives to uphold high ethical standards in her research which guides her work always towards achieving the community goals of her language of focus. In return for the help she received with her research, she proposed the creation of an online Mankon dictionary development project that could engage Mankon communities around the world. With this project, she aspires to create a generalizable documentation tool that can benefit any language community interested in documenting their own language. In the future, she hopes to explore the possibility of building AI tools for languages like Mankon with limited online resources.</p>
